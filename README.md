Create an app to show different emojis. The App should have the following
   functionality:
   1. The user should be able to get all of the emojis from
   https://emojihub.yurace.pro/api/all.
   2. Each emoji in response will have category field. Group all the emojis by
   their category and show them in separate views for each category.
   3. The main screen should have a Button to fetch the emojis and open a
   secondary screen with nested views to show the categorised emojis.
   4. Every view should show all emojis of the same category in a grid using the
   unicode field from the response.
   5. The app should be offline first. If there is no internet connectivity after
   successfully fetching the emojis at least once, I should still be able to see
   them in the views.
   UI/UX is up to you as long as it meets the above criteria. The app should be
   built with maintainability, testability, and reusability in mind.
